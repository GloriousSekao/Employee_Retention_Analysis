# Employee Retention Analysis
Analyzing factors impacting employee retention using HR data.

## Project Tasks
1. EDA: Identified key drivers of attrition (`satisfaction_level` strongest).
2. Visualized impact of **salary** and **department** on retention.
3. Built a **logistic regression model** to predict employee departure.
4. Achieved **~78% accuracy**.

## Key Findings
- Satisfaction level is the strongest predictor of employee retention.
- Salary level affects employee turnover.
- Department also influences retention patterns.

## Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: ~78%
- Confusion matrix heatmap shows strong predictions.

## Files
- `employee_retention_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code.
- `data/`: HR dataset (if uploading data).

## Conclusion
Leveraging ML techniques like logistic regresssions can effectively predict employee turnover, enabling organisations to make informed decisions and improve their retention strategies.
